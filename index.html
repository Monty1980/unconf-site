            <h1>Intersection: Tech + Education Unconference</h1>
            <blockquote>An unconference is a creation of the people who attend. This free invite-only event — hosted by Square — brings together the people we know and admire, and the people we want to know better. At Intersection, you can expect a diverse mix of ~75 entrepreneurs, hackers, program creators, industry innovators, academic leaders, technology pioneers, professors, and researchers.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>We provide the theme—how academic and industry can partner and influence each other—and you decide what to talk about and what to share.</blockquote>

        <h2>Before You Arrive</h2>
        <p>Whether Intersection is your first unconference or you’re a regular, we encourage you to read Scott Berkun’s article on how to run a great unconference session and peruse the unconference article on Wikipedia. <br>

<br>All about you:<br>
Help others get to know you before the event. Add your name, affiliation, email, and 3 words that describe you [here]. Friday evening, you’ll use the 3 words to introduce yourself to other attendees. 
<br><br>
Leave your mark:<br>
Intersection will only be as good as attendees make it. Be prepared to lead or participate in a session, ask questions, and show off your work. As a group on Friday, we will put together Saturday’s schedule; this will be your chance to sign up to lead a session.
<br><br>
What to bring:<br>
Please bring a laptop and adapter, and feel free to bring anything you would like to show or demo to attendees. If you need a table or space to set up your demo, please email alicia@squareup.com two week prior to the event. <br>
