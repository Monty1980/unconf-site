        <h1>The Intersection Unconference</h1>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>An unconference is a creation of the people who attend. This free invite-only event — hosted by Square — brings together the people we know and admire, and the people we want to know better. At Intersection, you can expect a diverse mix of 75 entrepreneurs, hackers, program creators, industry innovators, academic leaders, technology pioneers, professors, and researchers. 

<p>We provide the theme—how academic and industry can partner and influence each other—and you decide what to talk about and what to share.</p>
