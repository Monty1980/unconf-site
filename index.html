        <h1>The Intersection Unconference</h1>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>An unconference is a creation of the people who attend. This free invite-only event — hosted by Square — brings together the people we know and admire, and the people we want to know better. At Intersection, you can expect a diverse mix of 75 entrepreneurs, hackers, program creators, industry innovators, academic leaders, technology pioneers, professors, and researchers. 

We provide the theme—how academic and industry can partner and influence each other—and you decide what to talk about and what to share. </p></p>
